# FAQS

### What is **Timbre**?
Timbre is a blockchain-based forum architecture that aims to promote free speech through decentralization of power in content provision, moderation and block production.

### What is so unique about the **design of Timbre**? 
Timbre decouples content moderation from content storage to balance free speech with the need for moderation. Timbreâ€™s moderation design enables arbitrary content views for a pluralistic and inclusive community platform. Timbre decentralizes both content storage and content moderation to allow and for democratic control over both aspects of the social media infrastructure. Timbre's intentionally ephemeral design mitigates the problem of eventual re-centralization of control.

### What makes Timbre stand out in comparison to other platforms such as Twitter, Reddit etc.? What does it provide to address the issue of fake news, cyber bullying etc. 
The centralised nature of platforms such as Twitter, Reddit etc. gives extraordinary control over content to the platform owners. Any content that is not in line with the platform policies is taken down by the authorities. Timbre attempts to do none of that. However, to filter problematic content, we provide a moderation scheme that can be applied arbitrarily over content. 

### What is the Timbre Blockchain?
A Timbre blockchain stores the index of posts on a forum, transactions(money transfers and storage deals) and votes.

### What are Decibels and how can they be earned?
Decibel is the cryptocurrency associated with a Timbre blockchain. Decibels are distributed on useful work performed within the forum. Miner earns a reward upon a successful extension of the blockchain.

### How are miners chosen in Timbre Blockchain and what is the Delegated Proof of Stake algorithm?
Unlike Bitcoin, where a block producer needs to solve a cryptographic puzzle to mine a block which is resource intensive, Timbre uses a variation of the Proof-of-Stake algorithm. In DPOS, stakeholders(those who own the Timbre cryptocurrency - Decibels) vote from a list of candidates who intend to mine blocks. Candidates with maximum votes form a committee which produces blocks at their scheduled time.

### What are the different roles in Timbre Blockchain?
A user can become a: Miner/Storage Provider/Bandwidth Provider/Indexer/Poster.

### Is it necessary to run a full node to contribute to Timbre?
No. One can sign up as a user on an active indexer. Each user gets 10000 Decibels as trial decibel balance to post/use the Timbre forum.

### Where is the content stored?
To keep the block size as small as possible, the data is stored off-chain across Storage Providers. Storage Transactions called Deals are stored on the chain.

### How is content Moderated on Timbre?
Timbre provides a dynamic moderation scheme that can be arbitrarily applied to any Timbre forum. Building on the idea of community moderation, users can publish moderation streams i.e blacklists/whitelists of posts that can be applied over raw content for filtering. This however, does not imply the deletion of content.
